                "Offline" is the apt description for most villages in Ladakh, most of the time. Low population density spread across a vast, mountainous territory with ongoing border disputes. If villages have towers, they are often just 2G, and can be shut for "security purposes" at any time.

                Add COVID lockdowns, when an entire family can be demanding one device with one data plan, and children quickly give up on keeping up with school work.

                Yountan Yargyas Meshnet is addressing this issue. The offline education platform provides the best local and global learning material placed in Ladakh.

                The MeshNet holds more than the above and allows students of all ages to upload and share local video and audio content, poadcast a radio, livestream news, and has an email and phone system. It also supports workshops, melas, and student Q&A sessions.
            <p>
                Itâ€™s affordable, easy to code, install and use. And kids love having an ability to broaden their horizons.
